        <p>In 2014,</p>
        <div class="big-number">46 MILLION TONS</div>
        <p>of electronics were buried in landfills. Only 8 million, or ~13% of the total, were recycled. Televisions, batteries, phones, and other electronics contain dangerous chemicals which harm the environment and account for 70% of toxic waste in landfills. Not to mention the amount of space they take up.</p>

        <p>Every year,</p>
        <div class="big-number">50 BILLION DOLLARS</div>
        <p>worth of reusable material is thrown away in electronics.</p>
    </section>
    <p><strong>They waste money and resources.</strong> Electronics contain valuable and rare materials, including gold, copper, silicon, and palladium. When electronics are thrown away instead of recycled, those materials are lost in landfills and cannot be reused in new devices. That causes materials to grow more scarce and prices to go up.</p>

        <h2>How to help</h2>
        <p>When you buy new electronics, you're forcing more of those devices to be produced. Buy used electronics whenever possible, and sell any usable electronics you don't need to those who do. When phones, computers, televisions, or batteries have reached the end of their useful lives, always properly recycle them at a local recycling center. Use the map below to find one near you!</p>
        <p>(You can also drop off your old electronics at a nearby Best Buy or Staples!)</p>
